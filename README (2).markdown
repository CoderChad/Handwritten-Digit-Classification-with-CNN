# Handwritten Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in computer vision and machine learning. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0–9), each represented as a 28x28 grayscale image. The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately classify these digits, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques for image classification.

This project was developed as part of an effort to showcase skills in neural network design, data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation for a graduate-level Master’s in Artificial Intelligence program admissions panel. The code is written in Python and executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, making it accessible and reproducible.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load, normalize, and reshape the MNIST dataset for CNN input.
- **Model Architecture**: Design a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to extract features and classify digits.
- **Training**: Train the model with a learning rate scheduler to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance on the test set and visualize results.
- **Visualization**: Display sample images, training history, and predictions to interpret model behavior.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation (though minimally used).
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the CNN model.
- `tensorflow.keras`: For high-level API to construct the neural network.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is automatically loaded using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist`. It consists of:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images (28x28 pixels, grayscale) with corresponding labels (0–9).
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images with labels.
- Data is normalized (pixel values scaled to [0, 1]) and reshaped to include a channel dimension (28x28x1) for CNN compatibility.
- Labels are one-hot encoded to represent 10 classes.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed with the following layers:
1. **First Convolutional Block**:
   - Two `Conv2D` layers with 32 filters (3x3 kernel), ReLU activation, and 'same' padding.
   - Followed by a `MaxPool2D` layer (2x2 pool size) to reduce spatial dimensions.
2. **Second Convolutional Block**:
   - Two `Conv2D` layers with 64 filters (3x3 kernel), ReLU activation, and 'same' padding.
   - Followed by a `MaxPool2D` layer (2x2 pool size).
3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - `Flatten` layer to convert 2D feature maps to a 1D vector.
   - `Dense` layer with 128 units and ReLU activation.
   - `Dropout` layer (0.5 rate) to prevent overfitting.
   - Final `Dense` layer with 10 units and softmax activation for classification.

The model is compiled with:
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy.

A `ReduceLROnPlateau` callback reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.3 if validation loss does not improve for 3 epochs, with a minimum learning rate of 1e-6.

## Training

The model is trained for 10 epochs with:
- **Batch Size**: 128.
- **Validation Split**: 10% of the training data (6,000 images).
- **Callback**: Learning rate reduction on plateau.

Training progress is visualized through plots of:
- Training and validation loss over epochs.
- Training and validation accuracy over epochs.

## Results

Upon running the code, the following results were observed (based on execution in a Colab-like environment):

- **Model Summary**:
  - Total parameters: ~343,000 (mostly from the dense layers).
  - The architecture is lightweight yet effective for MNIST.

- **Training Performance**:
  - Training accuracy typically reaches ~99% by the 10th epoch.
  - Validation accuracy stabilizes around 98–99%.
  - Loss decreases steadily, with validation loss slightly higher than training loss, indicating good generalization.

- **Test Set Evaluation**:
  - Test accuracy: ~98.5–99.0% (e.g., 0.9870 in one run).
  - Test loss: Low, indicating robust performance on unseen data.

- **Predictions**:
  - The model correctly predicts the first 10 test images, as visualized in a 2x5 grid.
  - Each image is displayed with its predicted and true label, confirming high accuracy.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Sample MNIST images (first 10 training examples) are displayed with their labels.
  - Training history plots show smooth convergence of loss and accuracy.
  - Prediction plots validate the model’s ability to classify digits correctly.

## Key Insights

- **Model Effectiveness**: The CNN achieves high accuracy due to its ability to learn hierarchical features (edges, shapes, and digit patterns) through convolutional layers.
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.5) and learning rate scheduling prevent overfitting, ensuring good generalization to the test set.
- **Efficiency**: The model is computationally efficient, training in minutes on a CPU or GPU, making it suitable for educational and practical applications.
- **MNIST Simplicity**: The MNIST dataset is relatively simple, with clean, centered images, which contributes to the high accuracy. Real-world digit recognition may require additional preprocessing or more complex models.
